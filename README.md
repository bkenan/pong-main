# Pong game

This is an old school game from my own archive and would like to share it here as well just for fun :)
Pong is a two-dimensional classic video game that simulates table tennis. A player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. Use q for up and a for down on the left side; up and down arrows for the right side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. For each unsaved ball of the opponent, the player earns +1 point and the scores appears on top of the screen. The game continues till player are tired :)
